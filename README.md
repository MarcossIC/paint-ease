# [Paint Ease - Vanilla JavaScript Paint](https://marcossic.github.io/paint-ease)

**Paint Ease** It is a paint made without frameworks, it was a project that started with 3 simple files, when I was taking my first steps with canvas. I decided to use vite to take advantage of the functionalities it provides to optimize js, and easily manage dependencies

## Quick Start

To run the project locally it is very simple.

- You just need some `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn` or `bun` and NodeJS.
- In my case I used bun. Run `bun install` in root.
- Then Run `bun dev` in root.

Ready! You can see your local project at `http://localhost:5173`
